Absimpa --- Abstract Simple Parser
=======

is a class library to build recursive descent parsers. 

In contrast to many other approaches, this is an experiment in avoiding any absurdly-syntaxed syntax descriptions with home brewn DSLs or by misusing XML. Instead, the grammar is described by creating Java objects via method calls and constructors.
